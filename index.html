              <p>
                The documents required for a loan application may vary depending
                on the type of loan you are applying for. Generally, you will
                need to provide identification documents (such as a passport or
                driver's license), proof of income (such as pay stubs or tax
                returns), and information about the collateral (if applicable).
                Our loan officers will guide you through the specific
                requirements during the application process.
